## Project Description
This project involves building and evaluating three different machine learning models—Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression—using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains features such as radius, texture, perimeter, and area measurements, which are used to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B).

### Objective
The primary goal is to determine which model provides the best prediction accuracy and AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) score, while also offering interpretability and suitability for the given dataset.
